# 🩸 Horror Story Generator – Python Tkinter 👻  
🚀 **Day 8 of my #100DaysOfCode challenge**

This is my **Day 8** project of the challenge — and probably the *creepiest* yet! 😱  
Ever wanted a spooky tale to give you chills?  
This app fetches randomly generated horror stories and reads them aloud using **gTTS**!  
From creepy mirrors to haunted calls — every click is a new nightmare 😈

---

## ✨ Features  
- 🧠 Randomly displays horror stories (7–8 sentence long and spine-chilling!)  
- 🔊 Text-to-speech narration using `gTTS`  
- 🧾 Custom styled GUI with horror-themed fonts and colors  
- 🩸 Smooth tkinter layout with buttons & decorative header  
- 💀 Voice autoplay with story display

---

## 🛠️ Built With  
- `Python 3.x`  
- `Tkinter` – GUI Library  
- `gTTS` – Google Text-to-Speech  
- `random` – For randomized story selection  
- `os` – For playing and removing audio files

---

## 🚀 How to Run

1. **Clone this repository** or download the ZIP
   
2. Install dependencies :
   
```bash
pip install gtts
```
3. Run the app :
   
```bash
python short_horror.py
```

✅ Works on Mac (uses afplay). For Windows, replace os.system("afplay ...") with os.system("start ...").

🧠 What I Learned
	•	Writing and formatting multiline horror strings in Python
	•	Using gTTS to generate and play MP3 audio on the fly
	•	Styling tkinter GUI for dark theme aesthetics
	•	Adjusting layout with .place() and custom spacing
